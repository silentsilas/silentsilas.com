title: Verbal Blunder

No!   
That was simply a slip of the tongue.  
Is it too late for me to play along?

I fear I'm no longer as mysterious,   
As wise, and as fearless  
As I've implied myself to be.

I've revealed my true colors.   
I'll soon be discovered;  
This shall show my sheer stupidity!

\'Tis time to hang up my hat and accept this mistake  
Since it seems I don't quite have what it takes  
To fool these fools how non-foolish I am.  
If only things had gone according to plan,

For I have heard it said:  
He who knows, does not speak.  
He who speaks, does not know.  
I had taken this to heart  
And so my heart I would never show.
