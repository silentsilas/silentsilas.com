{{< poem >}}
Do you still claim for there to be
No chance of a random possibility
Because our God planned out eternity?
But what good does that do 
For the likes of me?

If you don't know the hand you're dealt
And faithfulness determines not your wealth,
Then why not loosen up your bible belt?
We can only ascertain 
Our ascent 
To heaven or hell.

The rain falls down on the wicked and the just.
We pack our bags and pray to God in whom we trust.
Our plans fall through as we return to dust
And beg our God 
To cure 
Our wanderlust.
