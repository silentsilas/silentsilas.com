I've seen tears fall  
From the face of a giant,  
A hint of desperation  
In the pleas of a king,

An attempt to forgive  
The guilt-tripping violent,  
Their genuine surprise  
That neither learned a thing.

The wishes of a mother  
Remain whispers in the wind,  
And the riches of the world  
In the words of humbled men.
