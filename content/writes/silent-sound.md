title: Silent Sound

---
Safely set inside this song  
Are silent sounds we passed along.  
Secret though we seek to know  
Signs of its new secret show.

Silence hides up in the skies  
Far from folks, cars, and lies.  
It only lives to watch us die,  
For that is when our souls arrive  
And silent sounds are synthesized.
