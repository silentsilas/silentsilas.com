Please present yourself to the class  
By sharing none of your secret past

Tell us your residence, your aspirations,  
Your chosen major's concentration,   
And maybe some more background knowledge   
As to why you're attending this specific college.

But anything more is unnecessary  
I mean, who cares your birthday's in February?

We learn not by the things you say  
But by the image you portray   
From the way you walk, talk, and stare   
And the ridiculous length of your untamed hair

Learning any more is unnecessary  
Learning any more is a little too scary
