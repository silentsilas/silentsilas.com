title: Take A Breather
---
{{< poem >}}
Disasters cannot happen
If anything is fine.

Lines cannot be crossed
If you don't draw a line.

Wishes do come true
If any change will do.

Pain loses its bite
If you enjoy the fight.

This makes sense at the surface,
But we shouldn't dull our senses.
Our suffering serves a purpose
So let's drop these false pretenses.

Sit with that sinking feeling
Until you reach its depths
To listen to its teachings;
Resurface to catch your breath.

Then look out to the horizon
To appreciate the view
Of all the potential futures;
You've a say in which comes true.
