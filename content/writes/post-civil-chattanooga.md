{{< poem >}}
This post-civil-war-torn-town
Gave refuge 
To the shackled and bound.

This town's river bubbled
With hope from beneath
To attract the outcast
And mask the town's deceit.

Traffic soon birthed
To industrial sound.

Its booming business
Broke the backs 
Of the beaten down.

Jim Crow rose 
To further ostracize
And whiteout the spots
Missed by redlines.

This town's river bubbled
With sewage from beneath.
Today's gentrified waters
Taste just as bittersweet.
