{{< poem >}}
Men are meant to move
Lest we wither and waste away
As we wade out in the ocean
In need of a crescent wave.

If you refuse to be moved,
You will sink like a stone.
But if you catch a wave,
You'll see you're not alone.

For we are all mostly water,
Each cell gasping for fresh air.
So why not splash into a wave?
We are waiting for you there.
