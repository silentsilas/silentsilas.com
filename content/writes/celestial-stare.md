title: Celestial Stare

{{< poem >}}
God and I locked eyes,
But it's hard to look into the face of whom you fear.
So instead, I gazed at the throne beneath Him;
The ulterior motive for my wicked heart to draw near.

God himself broke the stare as well,
For it's hard to look into the face of a disappointing son.
So instead, he gazed at Jesus within me
Who's changing my heart 'til we hold staring contests for fun.
