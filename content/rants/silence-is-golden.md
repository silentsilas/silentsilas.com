Hey there! Welcome to <a href="/writes/silent-silas/">Silent Silas</a>. I write code during the day, and poetry at night. This is my playground.

This section in particular is where I'll discuss my terrible opinions on life, the universe, and the <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/QUMSr4q5">objectification of humanity</a>.

For the web developers out there, this is a static site built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, styled with <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>, sped up with <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, and animated with both <a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a> and <a href="https://greensock.com/">GreenSock</a>. It'll eventually use <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-toolbox">Service Workers</a> so that the entirety of the site is available offline. 

As with most computer scientists, I stand on the <a href="/imgs/cs_abstraction.jpg">shoulders of giants</a>. 

The code is on <a href="https://github.com/Poeticode/silentsilas.com">Github</a> under the MIT license (while the poetry is under a restrictive Creative Commons license).
