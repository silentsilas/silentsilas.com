title: New Year's Retribution

---
Our past predicts how prone we are  
To repeat our mistakes in the present.  
New Year resolutions are made  
To prove ourselves convalescent.

Never again shall we regress  
Back to our frail and Fallen state.  
Instead, transform into super humans  
Gaining skills and losing weight.

Only then will we be pleased  
With who we see in the mirror.  
On the contrary, oft' we find  
What harms us, we hold dearer.

And so the cycle repeats itself  
As our resolutions are broken.  
Still, I vow to write more next year  
Despite what has just been spoken!
