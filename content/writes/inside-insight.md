{{< poem >}}
I pine not 
For grass or trees.
This pane of glass 
Looks fine to me.

Ever present 
Is every present
Presented as the moments pass.

Where last is first 
And first to class.
First to thirst 
For half-full glass.

Fully free 
To see worry
As irrational 
Impossibility.

For the soul you hold
Can be sold for gold;
You otherwise can't lose control.

Might lose a limb.
Might lose a friend.
Might loss matter 
When your matters end?
