{{< poem >}}
In a moment 
Of relapse,
A desire 
For love 
Arose.

I gave my heartstrings 
To a girl
To knit a warmer
Set of clothes.

I was hoping 
For a sweater,
But instead, 
Received her mask.

She thanked me kindly
For the coat
And I knew
I shouldn't ask.

Was it
Seasonal depression
That left me seeking
Out a sun?

A candle
Can't replace it,
But any fire
Is better than none.
