{{< poem >}}
You've gotta stay loose 

Like change

Before you're torn 
When the goods exchange

For the better

For the worse.

To be used
To the best
Is a curse.

This might not make sense 
Or cents 
Or millions,

But hindsight's a pretense
At the expense
Of resilience.

Take the tumble

For the worst
Is much better
Than whatever
Your temptors
Purport.

I can change
Thanks to change.

Otherwise, 
Remain

And sell short.
