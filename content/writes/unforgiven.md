{{< poem >}}
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
For apologizing again.
But who'll forgive me
If I hurt a good friend?

10 years ago 
(which isn't very long),
I knew hardly a soul
And spoke to no one.

He was never forgiven,
The kid of that day;
So I broke out of my shell
To then lock him away.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
I hear him cry out still,
So I ask that you forgive me,
Afraid that no one will.
