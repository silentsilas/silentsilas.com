title: Ill With Want

---
I could travel across the land  
Searching far and wide,  
But the grass will still seem greener  
On the other side.

I could be surrounded by people who love me  
Yet still feel I don't belong.  
I could think I'm a terrible person  
Despite how often told I'm wrong.

I could accomplish several amazing feats  
Yet still believe I'm inadequate.  
I could try my best to be nice  
Yet still remain the Devil's Advocate.

I could conquer all of Earth  
Yet still wish for Jupiter and Mars.  
I could conquer the milky way  
Yet still wish upon other stars.

Cause there's an endless wave of want in the air  
So what I want I can never obtain.  
Every attempt leaves a feeling of despair  
As I'm reminded of my ball and chain.

They say that Jesus is the answer  
And I know that I am God's child.  
Why, then, during my best days  
Can I sometimes find no reason to smile?

This is the impossible riddle of Life  
That happens to plague all of our minds.  
There is no answer that will suffice  
Until we're in heaven, body and mind refined.
