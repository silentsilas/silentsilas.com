{{< poem >}}
There's no reason for us to talk
As we discuss meteorological matters.
Our communal cup never fills up
For each time we lose touch, it shatters.

You see in me a man from before.
I see in you but a shallow shore
With a receding tide
Of our friendship folklore.

Is there nothing more?

I've tired of this one-sided conversation
So I'll retire and keep myself complacent
With an assuming posture 
And twiddling of thumbs
With the occasional interjection 
Of terribly clever puns.
