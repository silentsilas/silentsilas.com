{{< poem >}}
Your soul walks the plank
Once your journey begins.
It first could only sink,
But soon learned to swim.

You picked up the pace
At the sight of life's fins,
Headlong and headstrong
Until your head spins.

Your childhood caught up
And took you back under

To remind you 
Of the depths
Your soul sunk 
While you were younger.

The atmosphere was heavy already,
But now the pressure's compounded.

The soul remembers 
Its early cries for help
And cries again 
To find its fears unfounded.

We need others 
To lift us
Once our siren 
Has sounded.
