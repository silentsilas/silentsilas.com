{{< poem >}}
No one should be awake 
At this time of night.
Nothing good can come
From what I'll try to write.

My vision's a bit blurred
As I try to type
So I'm not quite sure
If the keys I press are right,
But I've come this far
So I'll press on in spite.

Thank you, Spellchecker. 
The overseer of my oversight.
