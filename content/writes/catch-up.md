{{< poem >}}
To your disbelief,
This moment passed.
You chased it down,
But it runs too fast.

It's one step ahead
In the wrong direction
Until you're lost
In imperfection.

==

To your relief,
This moment passed.
But you couldn't run
From its aftermath.

You sought out shelter
But had to keep moving
After planting the flowers
You'd never see blooming.
