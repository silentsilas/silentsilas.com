title: Of Molecules And Men
---
{{< poem >}}
May we lose 
All language
That we may see 
As it is
And not 
As we think,

For cells 
Arose
From division
To divide
And conquer
Molecules
And men.

From the 
Prokaryote
To the 
Proletariat
A conflict
Ensues.

You're so sure
That you're full
Of yourself
As your cells
Dismantle
All that's
Consumed.

We break to build
Each building block
Into a likeness
Worth worshipping to.

To be at peace
Is to decompose.

To cease to be
Is to become 
Every friend 
And alleged foe.
