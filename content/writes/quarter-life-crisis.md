title: Quarter-Life Crisis

---
{{< poem >}}
There's nothing better
Than a quarter-life crisis.

At the peak of your prime,
Catching up on lost time,
Fighting off vicious vices

By keeping yourself busy
And taking in all of the city
Without a care
For what its price is.

So long as you're no longer
Left to your own devices.
