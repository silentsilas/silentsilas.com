{{< poem >}}
<div style="white-space: pre;">The brain
    Signaled
        SHUTDOWN.
The mind
    Couldn't
        KEEP QUIET.
The eyes
    Were left
        ALL ALONE.
The body
    Can't run;
        CAN'T FIGHT IT.

Thoughts are now
        RACING
Wheels are now
        SPINNING
Fears turn to terror
And ask, "Who's winning?"
</div>
