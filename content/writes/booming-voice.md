title: Booming Voice

---
Silent explosions amidst the stars.  
Booming voices that created Mars.   
Yet Earth only his finger is placed   
And filled it with creatures the devil faced.

All of creation has now withered  
Thanks to the one who now slithers.   
But a complex plan has been made,   
And ages later death is slayed.

God is never seen yet is all-seeing  
Of all the actions of human beings.   
His guiding voice amidst speeding cars   
Now leads our souls beyond the stars.
