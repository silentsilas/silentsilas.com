Silence speaks louder than words  
At a decibel too loud to be heard  
As an abrupt disruption of nothin'  
For our conversation consumption.

Its presence is chilling  
And instant buzz-killing  
Yet still we act  
As if it's not there.

Our tongues are untied  
As the silence subsides  
Yet still its message  
Hangs heavy in the air.
