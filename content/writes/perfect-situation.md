title: Perfect Situation

---
{{< poem >}}
When I'm hammered,
I'm left enamored
And content 
With the Fate
Lady luck's prescribed.

Though we never
Will land together,
We're fledglings
With new wings
To take to the sky.

I ponder your passion
To pursue aspirations
And wonder what magic
You'll perform upon nations

And I speculate the odds
Given a perfect situation
In a parallel universe
If I'd rise to the occasion.
