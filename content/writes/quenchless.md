{{< poem >}}
The only
Drink that quenches
Dulls the senses
Until 
All discretion 
Is lost.

What
Enabled this dependence?
My college attendance?
Is that their 
Accreditation's cost?

Is it
The fault of my genes?
A man who 
Couldn't stay clean
Then passed down 
The{{< / poem >}} ~~bottles~~ {{< poem >}}battles he lost?

Or was it
My lack of socializing
That kept me subsidizing
Charisma 
With each drink 
I came across?

<div style="font-size: x-small; padding-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">These are the main reasons I would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPpZhPapkmc" target="_blank">take to drink</a>. With the social restrictions during 2020, drinking became even more prevalent due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7763183/" target="_blank">stress, increased alcohol availability, and general boredom</a>. I haven't found any studies regarding drinking and post-quarantine, but I could see another uptick in drinking due to people storming the bars once restrictions were lifted. As someone who moved to a new city knowing hardly a soul, I know I certainly did.
